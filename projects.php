			<li><b>Guide:</b>Dr. P. K. Das, IIT Guwahati</li>
			<li><b>Description:</b> The project aims to conduct acoustic and articulatory analysis for phonemes of languages. The main goal is to design a phoneme clustering algorithm similar to that of the "Soundex" algorithm, which is a text-based phonetic algorithm to encode the homophones to the same representation. This algorithm will be helpful for high quality multi-lingual speech recognition.</li>

			<li><b>Guide:</b>  Dr. P. K. Das, IIT Guwahati</li>
			<li><b>Description:</b>  The aim was to make a system which takes a spoken word as input at runtime and outputs the recognized word on screen in real time. The spoken word must belong to a predefined set of words. Hidden Markov Models were built for the words. Techniques used for building the models are Vector Quantization, Durbins Recursive Algorithm, k-Means clustering algorithm, Viterbi Algorithm.</li>

			<li><b>Guide:</b>  Dr. Tamaltaru Pal, ISI Kolkata</li>
			<li><b>Description:</b> The aim was to read a scanned image of typed Bengali script and convert it to Unicode text format. Image data was read from TIFF file and skew detection, binarization, horizontal clipping and vertical clipping was applied sequentially to detect a whole word. Then different features were extracted from the words and the recognizer was trained based on those features.</li>

			<li><b>Guide:</b> Dr. D. P. Mukherjee, ISI Kolkata</li>
			<li><b>Description:</b> The aim was to track an object, selected in the first frame throughout a video. Firstly brute force algorithm based on similarity measure of consecutive frames was used, secondly Lucas-Kanade method based on optical-flow estimation was used and finally mean shift tracking algorithm based on histogram estimation was used. OpenCV library was used for this project.</li>
